# Security Audit Report - Server Configuration Backup System

## üîí Security Audit Summary

**Audit Date**: $(date)
**Scripts Audited**: install.sh, server-config-backup.sh
**Severity Levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low

## ‚úÖ **VULNERABILITIES FIXED**

### 1. **Command Injection in Sudoers** - CRITICAL ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Location**: install.sh:69-71
- **Issue**: Wildcard in sudoers allowed arbitrary command execution
- **Fix**: Replaced wildcards with specific paths and commands
- **Impact**: Prevented privilege escalation to root

### 2. **Path Traversal in Git URL** - HIGH ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Location**: install.sh:179
- **Issue**: No validation against ../../../ patterns
- **Fix**: Added input sanitization and URL format validation
- **Impact**: Prevented access to unintended files

### 3. **Temporary File Race Condition** - MEDIUM ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Location**: server-config-backup.sh:219
- **Issue**: Insecure temporary file creation
- **Fix**: Added secure permissions (600) and ownership
- **Impact**: Prevented information disclosure

### 4. **Unvalidated User Input** - MEDIUM ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Location**: Multiple locations in interactive functions
- **Issue**: No input sanitization in user prompts
- **Fix**: Added input validation and sanitization
- **Impact**: Prevented injection attacks

### 5. **Configuration File Security** - MEDIUM ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Location**: server-config-backup.sh load_config()
- **Issue**: No permission checks on config file
- **Fix**: Added permission validation and correction
- **Impact**: Prevented unauthorized config access

## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS ADDED**

### Input Validation
- SSH-only Git repository URL validation (HTTPS removed)
- Email format validation
- Numeric input sanitization
- Path traversal prevention
- Character filtering for special characters

### File System Security
- Secure temporary file creation
- Configuration file permission enforcement (600)
- Backup directory path validation
- Rsync safety options (--no-specials, --no-devices, --safe-links)

### User Separation
- Dedicated backup user for Git operations
- Root isolation from Git providers
- Minimal privilege sudoers configuration
- Proper file ownership management

### Command Execution Safety
- Input sanitization before shell execution
- Path validation for all file operations
- Restricted sudoers rules with specific commands
- Git command execution as backup user only

## üîç **REMAINING SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS**

### Low Risk Items
1. **Log File Permissions**: Consider restricting log file access
2. **SSH Key Passphrase**: Could optionally support SSH key passphrases
3. **Git Credential Storage**: Monitor for credential exposure in logs
4. **Network Security**: Consider firewall rules for Git access

### Recommendations
1. **Regular Security Updates**: Keep system packages updated
2. **SSH Key Rotation**: Implement periodic SSH key rotation
3. **Audit Logging**: Consider adding more detailed audit logs
4. **Backup Encryption**: Consider encrypting backup data at rest
5. **Access Monitoring**: Monitor backup user activities

## üöÄ **SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED**

### ‚úÖ Principle of Least Privilege
- Backup user has minimal required permissions
- Root access limited to file reading only
- Specific sudoers rules instead of broad permissions

### ‚úÖ Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of input validation
- File system permission controls
- User separation architecture
- Command execution restrictions

### ‚úÖ Secure by Default
- Secure file permissions (600) for sensitive files
- SSH authentication ONLY (HTTPS removed for security)
- Private repository requirements
- Service account usage guidance

### ‚úÖ Input Validation
- All user inputs sanitized and validated
- Path traversal prevention
- URL format validation
- Numeric input restrictions

## üìã **SECURITY CHECKLIST**

- [x] Command injection vulnerabilities fixed
- [x] Path traversal attacks prevented
- [x] User input validation implemented
- [x] File permissions secured
- [x] Temporary files created securely
- [x] User separation implemented
- [x] Sudoers rules restricted
- [x] Git operations isolated from root
- [x] Configuration validation added
- [x] Rsync security options enabled

## üîß **DEPLOYMENT SECURITY NOTES**

1. **Run installer as root** for proper user creation and permissions
2. **SSH authentication ONLY** - HTTPS is not supported
3. **Create service accounts** in Git providers, not personal accounts
4. **Use private repositories** for all backup storage
5. **Monitor backup logs** for unusual activity
6. **Regularly update** system packages and dependencies

## üö´ **HTTPS REMOVAL**

**HTTPS Git URLs are no longer supported** because:
- Most providers deprecated password authentication
- Personal access tokens are complex for automation
- SSH is more reliable and secure for servers
- Eliminates token expiration issues

## üìû **SECURITY CONTACT**

For security issues or questions about this audit:
- Review the implemented fixes in the scripts
- Test in a non-production environment first
- Monitor system logs after deployment
- Report any security concerns immediately
